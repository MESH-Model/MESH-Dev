1) Avoid division if possible. If a variable is used for dividing in several equations, store the reciprocal in a separate variable and then use multiplication.

Slow example:
   do i=1,1000
   a(i)= b(i)/c
   enddo
Replace with:
   d=1/c
   do i=1,1000
   a(i)=b(i)*d
   enddo

2) Avoid using double precision unless it is really needed for accuracy.

4) Functions such as log, exp, sqrt, power, reciprocal,trignometric,
  are very time consuming. The MASS library provided by IBM
  improves the performance dramatically (often 10 fold!!)

Slow example:
   do i=1,1000
    a(i) = log(b(i))
   enddo

Replace with if double precision:
   call vlog(a,b,1000)
or replace with this for single precision:
   call vslog(a,b,1000)

What is already used in the dynamics and physics library:
vexp,vsexp
vlog,vslog
vcos,vscos
vsin,vssin
vsqrt,vssqrt
vrec,vsrec
vspown1

And there are many more so check in the IBM website at:

5) Producing NAN results will dramatically slow the performance.
