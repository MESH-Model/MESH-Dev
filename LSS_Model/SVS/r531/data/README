this folder contains the input and output data related to a SVS experiment;
if using SVS-type input data (hence a .intrp file),
you can use Create_SASVS_outputs_bal.py to compute daily watershed averages of some important variables
such as Evap., precip., temperature, soil moisture, etc.
you can then use sasvs_strf_perfs.py (needs a file of streamflow observations)
to plot the watershed outlet streamflow and compute hydrologic performances.
See inside the scripts (update last lines) for usage.
