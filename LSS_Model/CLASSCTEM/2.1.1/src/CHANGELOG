    * Version 2.1.1

        - Bug fixes to the albedo outputs
        - Bug fix in hetresv.f and hetresg.f. If the soil coming in was a peat soil it was being treated like a mineral soil. This could lead to problems where the ice content of soils was more than the (hetres calculated) porosity. Also hetresg was slightly different in calculating psi so I have made them the same.
        - Fixed bug where class only runs couldn't start at metcyclyrst. Fix was just to move the ctem_on switch so the metcyclyrst can occur with ctem on or off.
        - Made it so the netcdf maker properly does chunking and compression. This results in much smaller files and perhaps a speed increase.
        - The code can now deal with leap years in the incoming met files. Thanks to Jean-Sebastien Landry for the code changes. This also means an additional switch in the joboptions script.
        - Jean-Sebastien Landry also noticed and fixed some bugs in how the model takes monthly lightning data and spreads it out over the days. This is also fixed here.

    * Version 2.1.

    Major changes since version 2.0.5 include:

    * CLASS v 3.6. updated with changes (v. 3.6.1) to make version 3.6.2. Changes since the original release of CLASS 3.6 in December 2011 include:
        -   Jason Cole's (ECCC) new optional four-band calculation for the albedo of snow on the ground (three bands in the near-IR)
        -   Paul Bartlett (ECCC) new albedo values for snow-covered canopy
        -   Optional use of a global database of soil “colour”, on the basis of which wet and dry soil albedos are assigned
        -   Corrections to the calculations of screen variables that are done with DRCOEF (ISLFD=0)
        -   Change iteration limit for bisection iteration scheme in TSOLVE and TSOLVC back to 50
        -   New upper limit on snow depth
        -   Change wilting point matric potential back to fixed value of 150 m, as in CLASS 2.7, and calculate wilting point soil water content based on this
        -   Re-introduce old soil texture-based soil albedo calculations as an option alongside the new "colour" database, for local studies.
            Add new value for rock albedo.
        -   Fixes in GRINFL and TSOLVE to handle evaporation over rock
        -   Fixes to treatment of urban albedo
        -   Bugfixes in call to DIASURFZ
        -   Replace MERGE in SCREENRH for compatibility with f77
        -   Comments in several subroutines describing all the above changes
        -   Removal of WLOST term.
        -   Other CLASS changes include fully incorporating the CLASS manual into the code and formatting the code for doxygen

    * CTEM changes from version 2.0.5 include:
        - New soil uptake of methane subroutine based on Curry (2007)
        - Small bug fix for heterotrophic respiration as noted by Yuanqiao Wu (during freezing of soil).
        - CTEM code adapted so can handle >3 soil layers
        - Bug fix to fire and made all outputs per pft. Reparameterized fire spread rates,extn_par1, rep_area and the combustion and mortality factors.
        - Reproductive costs for plants is now on by default (previously only for competition runs).
        - Canopy temperature is again used for photosynthesis
        - PAI minimum for trees is the same as for crops and grasses.
        - Vcmax changes seasonally for NDL-DCD and BDL-COLD-DCD following Bauerle et al. 2012
        - Vcmax for NDL-EVG reduced following tests at Fluxnet sites and global.
        - Wetland determination is now a smooth function rather than thresholds also new parameter values.
        - The default mosaic structure is no longer one tile per pft (although that option remains). Now you
          can have as many pfts per tile as required.
        - Major changes to the runclassctem driver. It was bloated so have stripped out some work into subroutines.
        - New input/output driver (io_driver.f90)
        - All model outputs written to file now in scientific notation
        - Bug fixes for dealing with tiled (mosaic) runs.
        - New structure of ctem_statevars which holds the CTEM variables and allows the use of pointers
        - Many changes to output file formats in an attempt to make them easier to deal with.
        - ctem.f changed to ctem.f90

    * All model code is now setup for doxygen and is thereby self-documenting. This is still a work in progress. Important new folders include
        - html: open index.html with any browser to look at the code manual
        - latex: run make in that folder to produce refman.pdf
