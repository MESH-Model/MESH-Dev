              newly-developed representative concentration pathways (RCPs) of
              greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols. Allowable emissions
              required to achieve the future atmospheric CO2 concentration
              pathways, are reported for the RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios.
              For the historical 1850–2005 period, cumulative land plus ocean
              carbon uptake and, consequently, cumulative diagnosed emissions
              compare well with observation-based estimates. The simulated
              historical carbon uptake is somewhat weaker for the ocean and
              stronger for the land relative to their observation-based
              estimates. The simulated historical warming of 0.9°C compares
              well with the observation-based estimate of 0.76 ± 0.19°C. The
              RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios respectively yield warmings of
              1.4, 2.3, and 4.9°C and cumulative diagnosed fossil fuel
              emissions of 182, 643 and 1617 Pg C over the 2006–2100 period.
              The simulated warming of 2.3°C over the 1850–2100 period in the
              RCP 2.6 scenario, with the lowest concentration of GHGs, is
              slightly larger than the 2°C warming target set to avoid
              dangerous climate change by the 2009 UN Copenhagen Accord. The
              results of this study suggest that limiting warming to roughly
              2°C by the end of this century is unlikely since it requires an
              immediate ramp down of emissions followed by ongoing carbon
              sequestration in the second half of this century.",

  abstract  = "Leaf phenology remains one of the most difficult processes to
               parameterize in terrestrial ecosystem models because our
               understanding of the physical processes that initiate leaf onset
               and senescence is incomplete. While progress has been made at
               the molecular level, for example by identifying genes that are
               associated with senescence and flowering for selected plant
               species, a picture of the processes controlling leaf phenology
               is only beginning to emerge. A variety of empirical formulations
               have been used with varying degrees of success in terrestrial
               ecosystem models for both extratropical and tropical biomes. For
               instance, the use of growing degree-days (GDDs) to initiate leaf
               onset has received considerable recognition and this approach is
               used in a number of models. There are, however, limitations when
               using GDDs and other empirically based formulations in global
               transient climate change simulations.The phenology scheme
               developed for the Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (CTEM),
               designed for inclusion in the Canadian Centre for Climate
               Modelling and Analysis coupled general circulation model, is
               described. The representation of leaf phenology is general
               enough to be applied over the globe and sufficiently robust for
               use in transient climate change simulations. Leaf phenology is
               functionally related to the (possibly changing) climate state
               and to atmospheric composition rather than to geographical
               boundaries or controls implicitly based on current climate. In
               this approach, phenology is controlled by environmental
               conditions as they affect the carbon balance. A
               carbon-gain-based scheme initiates leaf onset when it is
               beneficial for the plant, in carbon terms, to produce new
               leaves. Leaf offset is initiated by unfavourable environmental
               conditions that incur carbon losses and these include shorter
               day length, cooler temperatures, and dry soil moisture
               conditions. The comparison of simulated leaf onset and offset
               times with observation-based estimates for temperate and boreal
               deciduous, tropical evergreen, and tropical deciduous plant
               functional types at selected locations indicates that the
               phenology scheme performs satisfactorily. Model simulated leaf
               area index and stem and root biomass are also compared with
               observational estimates to illustrate the performance of CTEM.",

  abstract = "Abstract Root distribution is treated as a static component in
              most current dynamic vegetation models (DVMs). While changes in
              leaf and stem biomass are reflected in leaf area index (LAI) and
              vegetation height via specific leaf area (SLA) and allometric
              relationships, most DVMs assume that changes in root biomass do
              not result in changes in the root distribution profile and
              rooting depth. That is, the fraction of roots in soil layers,
              which is used to estimate transpiration, is taken to be constant
              and independent of root biomass and/or vegetation age. A
              methodology for parameterizing root distribution as a function of
              root biomass is proposed for use in dynamic vegetation models. In
              this representation, root distribution and rooting depth evolve
              and increase as root biomass increases, as is expected
              intuitively and as is seen in observations. Root biomass data
              from temperate coniferous, tropical evergreen, and tundra sites
              show that the approach successfully represents, to the first
              order, the change of root distribution and rooting depth as a

               requires an accurate assessment of plant rooting distributions.
               Here, in a comprehensive literature synthesis, we analyze
               rooting patterns for terrestrial biomes and compare
               distributions for various plant functional groups. We compiled a
               database of 250 root studies, subdividing suitable results into
               11 biomes, and fitted the depth coefficient β to the data for
               each biome (Gale and Grigal 1987). β is a simple numerical index
               of rooting distribution based on the asymptotic equation Y=1-βd,
               where d = depth and Y = the proportion of roots from the surface
               to depth d. High values of β correspond to a greater proportion
               of roots with depth. Tundra, boreal forest, and temperate
               grasslands showed the shallowest rooting profiles (β=0.913,
               0.943, and 0.943, respectively), with 80–90\% of roots in the
               top 30 cm of soil; deserts and temperate coniferous forests
               showed the deepest profiles (β=0.975 and 0.976, respectively)
               and had only 50\% of their roots in the upper 30 cm. Standing
               root biomass varied by over an order of magnitude across biomes,
               from approximately 0.2 to 5 kg m-2. Tropical evergreen forests
               had the highest root biomass (5 kg m-2), but other forest biomes
               and sclerophyllous shrublands were of similar magnitude. Root
               biomass for croplands, deserts, tundra and grasslands was below
               1.5 kg m-2. Root/shoot (R/S) ratios were highest for tundra,
               grasslands, and cold deserts (ranging from 4 to 7); forest
               ecosystems and croplands had the lowest R/S ratios
               (approximately 0.1 to 0.5). Comparing data across biomes for
               plant functional groups, grasses had 44\% of their roots in the
               top 10 cm of soil. (β=0.952), while shrubs had only 21\% in the
               same depth increment (β=0.978). The rooting distribution of all
               temperate and tropical trees was β=0.970 with 26\% of roots in
               the top 10 cm and 60\% in the top 30 cm. Overall, the globally
               averaged root distribution for all ecosystems was β=0.966 (r
               2=0.89) with approximately 30\%, 50\%, and 75\% of roots in the
               top 10 cm, 20 cm, and 40 cm, respectively. We discuss the merits

  abstract = "Abstract The global distribution of vegetation is broadly
              determined by climate, and where bioclimatic parameters are
              favorable for several plant functional types (PFTs), by the
              competition between them. Most current dynamic global vegetation
              models (DGVMs) do not, however, explicitly simulate inter-PFT
              competition and instead determine the existence and fractional
              coverage of PFTs based on quasi-equilibrium climate–vegetation
              relationships. When competition is explicitly simulated, versions
              of Lotka–Volterra (LV) equations developed in the context of
              interaction between animal species are almost always used. These
              equations may, however, exhibit unrealistic behavior in some
              cases and do not, for example, allow the coexistence of different
              PFTs in equilibrium situations. Coexistence may, however, be
              obtained by introducing features and mechanisms such as temporal
              environmental variation and disturbance, among others. A
              generalized version of the competition equations is proposed that
              includes the LV equations as a special case, which successfully
              models competition for a range of climate and vegetation regimes
              and for which coexistence is a permissible equilibrium solution
              in the absence of additional mechanisms. The approach is tested

  abstract  = "* 1The first trees establishing in grasslands may indirectly
               favour their seedlings in competition with neighbouring
               herbaceous vegetation by increasing soil fertility with
               nitrogen-rich litter and by reducing light levels under their
               canopies. It is predicted that increasing soil nitrogen
               availability will accelerate invasion of trees by stimulating
               their growth more than that of herbaceous species. Decreasing
               light availability is predicted to increase tree invasion by
               limiting the growth of herbaceous vegetation more than that of
               trees (competitive release). * 2We tested these predictions
               using Chinese tallow tree (Sapium sebiferum), which is an
               aggressive alien invader of grasslands in the southern USA, and
               Hackberry (Celtis laevigata), which is a native tree common in
               these grasslands. * 3Nitrogen and light were manipulated in two
               factorial field experiments in grasslands in Texas, USA. In the
               first, nitrogen was increased and light was decreased in plots
               with planted Celtis or Sapium seedlings. In the second
               experiment, light availability to planted Celtis or Sapium
               seedlings was increased by holding back prairie vegetation. *
               4In the first experiment, growth of Celtis and Sapium seedlings
               increased with nitrogen fertilization while the above-ground
               biomass of prairie vegetation did not change. Prairie vegetation
               biomass decreased and tree seedling growth increased under
               shading. Sapium's growth increased dramatically in the treatment
               with combined nitrogen and shade. Sapium survival decreased when
               shade was applied. * 5In the second experiment, Sapium growth
               increased with increased light. Thus, increased Sapium growth at
               low light levels in the shade experiment was probably a
               consequence of decreased competitive interference from prairie
               vegetation, rather than better absolute performance of Sapium in
               low light levels. * 6These results provide evidence for
               facilitation as a mechanism involved in tree invasions of
               grasslands. Changes in resource levels, perhaps in combination
               with other factors, may explain rapid conversion of grassland
               communities to woodlands after the first pioneer trees are
               established. The marked response of Sapium to the combination of
               nitrogen and shade suggests that these positive feedbacks may be
               particularly strong for this alien plant species.",

  abstract = "The problem of scale has been a critical impediment to
              incorporating important fine-scale processes into global
              ecosystem models. Our knowledge of fine-scale physiological and
              ecological processes comes from a variety of measurements,
              ranging from forest plot inventories to remote sensing, made at
              spatial resolutions considerably smaller than the large scale at
              which global ecosystem models are defined. In this paper, we
              describe a new individual-based, terrestrial biosphere model,
              which we label the ecosystem demography model (ED). We then
              introduce a general method for scaling stochastic
              individual-based models of ecosystem dynamics (gap models) such
              as ED to large scales. The method accounts for the fine-scale
              spatial heterogeneity within an ecosystem caused by stochastic
              disturbance events, operating at scales down to individual
              canopy-tree-sized gaps. By conditioning appropriately on the
              occurrence of these events, we derive a size- and age-structured
              (SAS) approximation for the first moment of the stochastic
              ecosystem model. With this approximation, it is possible to make
              predictions about the large scales of interest from a description
              of the fine-scale physiological and population-dynamic processes
              without simulating the fate of every plant individually. We use
              the SAS approximation to implement our individual-based biosphere
              model over South America from 15° N to 15° S, showing that the
              SAS equations are accurate across a range of environmental
              conditions and resulting ecosystem types. We then compare the
              predictions of the biosphere model to regional data and to
              intensive data at specific sites. Analysis of the model at these
              sites illustrates the importance of fine-scale heterogeneity in
              governing large-scale ecosystem function, showing how population
              and community-level processes influence ecosystem composition and

               major improvements and additions to the prototype model
               developed by Foley et al. [1996]. IBIS is designed to be a
               comprehensive model of the terrestrial biosphere; the model

               dynamics of these interactions with respect to wildland fire are
               often difficult to understand and identify at short temporal
               scales. Dendrochronological fire histories from the Missouri
               Ozarks, coupled with human population data, offer a quantitative
               means of examining historic (1680–1990) changes in the
               anthropogenic fire regime. A temporal analysis of fire scar
               dates over the last 3 centuries indicates that the percent of
               sites burned and fire intervals of anthropogenic fires are
               conditioned by the following four limiting factors: (a)
               anthropogenic ignition, (b) surface fuel production, (c) fuel
               fragmentation, and (d) cultural behavior. During an
               ignition-dependent stage (fewer than 0.64 humans/km2), the
               percent of sites burned is logarithmically related to human
               population (r 2 = 0.67). During a fuel-limited stage, where
               population density exceeds a threshold of 0.64 humans/km2, the
               percent of sites burned is independent of population increases
               and is limited by fuel production. During a fuel-fragmentation
               stage, regional trade allows population densities to increase
               above 3.4 humans/km2, and the percent of sites burned becomes
               inversely related to population (r 2 = 0.18) as decreases in
               fuel continuity limit the propagation of surface fires. During a
               culture-dependent stage, increases in the value of timber over
               forage greatly reduce the mean fire interval and the percent of
               sites burned. Examples of the dynamics of these four stages are

              Model results for carbon and energy fluxes compare well with

               rate (R) and temperature (T) the goodness of fit of various R vs
               T relationships was evaluated. 2. Exponential (Q10) and
               conventional Arrhenius relationships between T and R cannot
               provide an unbiased estimate of respiration rate. Nor is a
               simple linear relationship appropriate. 3. The relationship
               between R and T can, however, be accurately represented by an
               Arrhenius type equation where the effective activation energy
               for respiration varies inversely with temperature. An empirical
               equation is presented which yields an unbiased estimator of
               respiration rates over a wide range of temperatures. 4. When
               combined with seasonal estimates of Gross Primary Productivity
               (GPP) the empirical relationship derived provides representative
               estimates of the seasonal cycle of net ecosystem productivity

               of net ecosystem productivity is very sensitive to the assumed
               respiration vs temperature relationship. 5. For biomes in areas
               where soil temperatures are low, soil respiration rate is
               relatively more sensitive to fluctuations in temperature.

  author   = "Kirschbaum, Miko U.f.",
  abstract = "One of the key questions in climate change research relates to
              the future dynamics of the large amount of C that is currently
              stored in soil organic matter. Will the amount of C in this pool
              increase or decrease with global warming? The future trend in
              amounts of soil organic C will depend on the relative temperature
              sensitivities of net primary productivity and soil organic matter
              decomposition rate. Equations for the temperature dependence of
              net primary productivity have been widely used, but the
              temperature dependence of decomposition rate is less clear. The
              literature was surveyed to obtain the temperature dependencies of
              soil respiration and N dynamics reported in different studies.
              Only laboratory-based measurements were used to avoid confounding
              effects with differences in litter input rates, litter quality,
              soil moisture or other environmental factors. A considerable
              range of values has been reported, with the greatest relative
              sensitivity of decomposition processes to temperature having been
              observed at low temperatures. A relationship fitted to the
              literature data indicated that the rate of decomposition
              increases with temperature at 0°C with a Q10 of almost 8. The
              temperature sensitivity of organic matter decomposition decreases
              with increasing temperature, indicated by the Q10 decreasing with
              temperature to be about 4.5 at 10°C and 2.5 at 20°C. At low
              temperatures, the temperature sensitivity of decomposition was
              consequently much greater than the temperature sensitivity of net
              primary productivity, whereas the temperature sensitivities
              became more similar at higher temperatures. The much higher
              temperature sensitivity of decomposition than for net primary
              productivity has important implications for the store of soil
              organic C in the soil. The data suggest that a 1°C increase in
              temperature could ultimately lead to a loss of over 10\% of soil
              organic C in regions of the world with an annual mean temperature
              of 5°C, whereas the same temperature increase would lead to a
              loss of only 3\% of soil organic C for a soil at 30°C. These
              differences are even greater in absolute amounts as cooler soils
              contain greater amounts of soil organic C. This analysis supports
              the conclusion of previous studies which indicated that soil
              organic C contents may decrease greatly with global warming and
              thereby provide a positive feed-back in the global C cycle.",

  author   = "Jobbágy, Esteban G. and Jackson, Robert B.",
  abstract = "As the largest pool of terrestrial organic carbon, soils interact
              strongly with atmospheric composition, climate, and land cover
              change. Our capacity to predict and ameliorate the consequences
              of global change depends in part on a better understanding of the
              distributions and controls of soil organic carbon (SOC) and how
              vegetation change may affect SOC distributions with depth. The
              goals of this paper are (1) to examine the association of SOC
              content with climate and soil texture at different soil depths;
              (2) to test the hypothesis that vegetation type, through patterns
              of allocation, is a dominant control on the vertical distribution
              of SOC; and (3) to estimate global SOC storage to 3 m, including
              an analysis of the potential effects of vegetation change on soil
              carbon storage. We based our analysis on >2700 soil profiles in
              three global databases supplemented with data for climate,
              vegetation, and land use. The analysis focused on mineral soil
              layers. Plant functional types significantly affected the
              vertical distribution of SOC. The percentage of SOC in the top 20
              cm (relative to the first meter) averaged 33\%, 42\%, and 50\%
              for shrublands, grasslands, and forests, respectively. In
              shrublands, the amount of SOC in the second and third meters was
              77\% of that in the first meter; in forests and grasslands, the
              totals were 56\% and 43\%, respectively. Globally, the relative
              distribution of SOC with depth had a slightly stronger
              association with vegetation than with climate, but the opposite
              was true for the absolute amount of SOC. Total SOC content
              increased with precipitation and clay content and decreased with
              temperature. The importance of these controls switched with
              depth, climate dominating in shallow layers and clay content
              dominating in deeper layers, possibly due to increasing
              percentages of slowly cycling SOC fractions at depth. To control
              for the effects of climate on vegetation, we grouped soils within
              climatic ranges and compared distributions for vegetation types
              within each range. The percentage of SOC in the top 20 cm
              relative to the first meter varied from 29\% in cold arid
              shrublands to 57\% in cold humid forests and, for a given
              climate, was always deepest in shrublands, intermediate in
              grasslands, and shallowest in forests (P < 0.05 in all cases).
              The effect of vegetation type was more important than the direct
              effect of precipitation in this analysis. These data suggest that
              shoot/root allocations combined with vertical root distributions,
              affect the distribution of SOC with depth. Global SOC storage in
              the top 3 m of soil was 2344 Pg C, or 56\% more than the 1502 Pg
              estimated for the first meter (which is similar to the total SOC
              estimates of 1500–1600 Pg made by other researchers). Global
              totals for the second and third meters were 491 and 351 Pg C, and
              the biomes with the most SOC at 1–3 m depth were tropical
              evergreen forests (158 Pg C) and tropical grasslands/savannas
              (146 Pg C). Our work suggests that plant functional types,
              through differences in allocation, help to control SOC
              distributions with depth in the soil. Our analysis also
              highlights the potential importance of vegetation change and SOC

  abstract = "This paper presents a system of models for the simulation of gas
              and energy exchange of a leaf of a C3 plant in free air. The
              physiological processes are simulated by sub-models that: (a)
              give net photosynthesis (An) as a function of environmental and
              leaf parameters and stomatal conductance (gs); (b) give g, as a
              function of the concentration of CO2 and H2O in air at the leaf
              surface and the current rate of photosynthesis of the leaf. An
              energy balance and mass transport sub-model is used to couple the
              physiological processes through a variable boundary layer to the
              ambient environment.The models are based on theoretical and
              empirical analysis of gs, and An measured at the leaf level, and
              tests with intact attached leaves of soybeans show very good
              agreement between predicted and measured responses of gs and An
              over a wide range of leaf temperatures (20–35°C), CO2
              concentrations (10–90 Pa), air to leaf water vapor deficits
              (0.5–3.7 kPa) and light intensities (100–2000 μmol m−2s−1).The
              combined models were used to simulate the responses of latent
              heat flux (λE) and gs for a soybean canopy for the course of an
              idealized summer day, using the ‘big-leaf’ approximation.
              Appropriate data are not yet available to provide a rigorous test
              of these simulations, but the response patterns are similar to
              field observations. These simulations show a pronounced midday
              depression of λE and gs at low or high values of boundary-layer
              conductance. Deterioration of plant water relations during midday
              has often been invoked to explain this common natural phenomenon,
              but the present models do not consider this possibility. Analysis
              of the model indicates that the simulated midday depression is,
              in part, the result of positive feedback mediated by the boundary
              layer. For example, a change in gs affects An and λE. As a
              consequence, the temperature, humidity and CO2 concentration of
              the air in the proximity of the stomata (e.g. the air at the leaf
              surface) change and these, in turn, affect gs. The simulations
              illustrate the possible significance of the boundary layer in
              mediating feedback loops which affect the regulation of stomatal
              conductance and λE. The simulations also examine the significance
              of changing the response properties of the photosynthetic
              component of the model by changing leaf protein content or the
              CO2 concentration of the atmosphere.",

  author   = "Collatz, GJ and Ribas-Carbo, M and Berry, JA",
  abstract = "Leaf based models of net photosynthesis (A n ) and stomatal
              conductance (g) are often components of whole plant, canopy and
              regional models of net primary productivity and surface energy
              balance. Since C 4 metabolism shows unique responses to
              environmental conditions and C 4 species are important
              agriculturally and ecologically, a realistic and accurate leaf
              model specific to C 4 plants is needed. In this paper we develop
              a simple model for predicting A n and g from leaves of C 4 plants
              that is easily parameterised and that predicts many of the
              important environmental responses. We derive the leaf model from
              a simple biochemical-intercellular transport model of C 4
              photosynthesis that includes inorganic carbon fixation by PEP
              carboxylase, light dependent generation of PEP and RuBP, rubisco
              reaction kinetics, and the diffusion of inorganic carbon and O 2
              between the bundle sheath and mesophyll. We argue that under most
              conditions these processes can be described simply as three
              potentially limiting steps. The leaf photosynthesis model treats
              A n as first order with respect to either light, CO 2 or the
              amount of rubisco present and produces a continuous transition
              between limitations. The independent variables of the leaf
              photosynthesis model are leaf temperature (T I ), intercellular
              CO 2 levels and the absorbed quantum flux. A simple linear model
              of g in terms of A n and leaf surface CO 2 level (p s ) and
              relative humidity (h s ) is combined with the photosynthesis
              model to give leaf photosynthesis as a function of absorbed
              quantum flux, T 1 and p s and h s levels. Gas exchange
              measurements from corn leaves exposed to varied light, CO 2 and
              temperature levels are used to parameterise and test the models.
              Model parameters are determined by fitting the models to a set of
              21 measurements. The behaviour of the models is compared with an
              independent set of 71 measurements, and the predictions are shown
              to be highly correlated with the data. Under most conditions the
              leaf model can be parameterised simply by determining the level
              of rubisco in the leaves. The effects of light environment,
              nutritional status and water stress levels on A n and g can be
              accounted for by appropriate adjustment of the capacity for
              rubisco to fix CO 2 . We estimate rubsico capacity from CO 2 and
              light saturated photosynthesis although leaf nitrogen content or
              rubisco assays from leaf extracts could also be used for this
              purpose.",

                 investigated possible mechanisms underlying this phenomenon in
                 leaves of Eperua grandiflora (Aubl.) Benth. saplings. This
                 tropical tree establishes in small gaps in the rainforest
                 canopy where direct sunlight can raise midday temperatures
                 markedly. We simulated this microclimate in a growth chamber
                 by varying air temperature between 28 and 38 degrees C at
                 constant vapor pressure. A decrease in stomatal conductance in
                 response to an increase in leaf-to-air vapor pressure
                 difference (deltaW) caused by an increase in leaf temperature
                 (Tleaf) was the principal reason for the decrease in net
                 photosynthesis between 28 and 33 degrees C. Net photosynthesis
                 decreased further between 33 and 38 degrees C. Direct effects
                 on mesophyll functioning and indirect effects through deltaW
                 were of similar magnitude in this temperature range.
                 Mitochondrial respiration during photosynthesis was
                 insensitive to Tleaf over the investigated temperature range;
                 it thus did not contribute to midday depression of net
                 photosynthesis. Internal conductance for CO2 diffusion in the
                 leaf, estimated by combined gas exchange and chlorophyll
                 fluorescence measurements, decreased slightly with increasing
                 Tleaf. However, the decrease in photosynthetic rate with
                 increasing Tleaf was larger and thus the difference in CO2
                 partial pressure between the substomatal cavity and
                 chloroplast was smaller, leading to the conclusion that this
                 factor was not causally involved in midday depression.
                 Carboxylation capacity inferred from the CO2 response of
                 photosynthesis increased between 28 and 33 degrees C, but
                 remained unchanged between 33 and 38 degrees C. Increased
                 oxygenation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate relative to its
                 carboxylation and the concomitant increase in photorespiration
                 with increasing Tleaf were thus not compensated by an increase
                 in carboxylation capacity over the higher temperature range.
                 This was the principal reason for the negative effect of high
                 midday temperatures on mesophyll functioning.",

                 measurements of CO2 and light response curves on blue oak
                 leaves (Quercus douglasii H. \& A.) were conducted weekly
                 throughout the growing season to study the seasonality of

                 prolonged summer drought and high temperature. A leaf

                 pronounced seasonal pattern in Vcmax. The maximum value of
                 Vcmax, 127 micromol m(-2) s(-1), was reached shortly after
                 leaf expansion in early summer, when air temperature was
                 moderate and soil water availability was high. Thereafter,
                 Vcmax declined as the soil water profile became depleted and
                 the trees experienced extreme air temperatures, exceeding 40
                 degrees C. The decline in Vcmax was gradual in midsummer,
                 however, despite extremely low predawn leaf water potentials
                 (Psipd, approximately -4.0 MPa). Overall, temporal changes in
                 Vcmax were well correlated with changes in leaf nitrogen
                 content. During spring leaf development, high rates of leaf
                 dark respiration (Rd, 5-6 micromol m(-2) s(-1)) were observed.
                 Once a leaf reached maturity, Rd remained low, around 0.5
                 micromol m(-2) s(-1). In contrast to the strong seasonality of
                 Vcmax, m and marginal water cost per unit carbon gain (partial
                 partial differential E/ partial partial differential A) were
                 relatively constant over the season, even when leaf Psipd
                 dropped to -6.8 MPa. The constancy of partial partial
                 differential E/ partial partial differential A suggests that
                 stomata behaved optimally under severe water-stress
                 conditions. We discuss the implications of our findings in the

               in relation to single environmental variables in part because
               the interactions between factors have appeared difficult to
               quantify in a simple way. A linear correlation between stomatal
               conductance (g) and CO2 assimilation rate (A) has been reported
               when photon fluence was varied and when the photosynthetic
               capacity of leaves was altered by growth conditions, provided
               CO2, air humidity and leaf temperature were constant (1).
               Temperature and humidity are, however, not consistent in nature.
               Lack of a concise description of stomatal responses to
               combinations of environmental factors has limited attempts to
               integrate these responses into quantitative models of leaf
               energy balance, photosynthesis, and transpiration. Moreover,
               this lack has hindered progress toward understanding the
               stomatal mechanism. We have taken a multi-variant approach to
               the study of stomatal conductance and we show that under many
               conditions the responses of stornata can be described by a set

               leaf carbon metabolism and the environment to predict fluxes of
               CO2, H2O and energy. In this paper, we show how the model of

              for the 1850–2000 period offers the possibility of testing and

              the simulated changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration and in
              land and ocean uptake with observation-based information. In
              particular, some of the uncertainties associated with the
              treatment of land use change (LUC) and the role of down
              regulation in affecting the strength of CO2 fertilization for
              terrestrial photosynthesis are assessed using the Canadian Centre
              for Climate Modelling and Analysis Earth System Model (CanESM1).
              LUC emissions may be specified as an external source of CO2 or
              calculated interactively based on estimated changes in crop area.
              The evidence for photosynthetic down regulation is reviewed and
              an empirically based representation is implemented and tested in
              the model. Four fully coupled simulations are performed: with and
              without terrestrial photosynthesis down regulation and with
              interactively determined or specified LUC emissions. Simulations
              without terrestrial photosynthesis down regulation yield 15–20
              ppm lower atmospheric CO2 by the end of the twentieth century,
              compared to observations, regardless of the LUC approach used
              because of higher carbon uptake by land. Implementation of down
              regulation brings simulated values of atmospheric CO2 and land
              and ocean carbon uptake closer to observation-based values. The
              use of specified LUC emissions yields a large source in the
              tropics during the 1981–2000 period, which is inconsistent with
              studies suggesting the tropics to be near-neutral or small carbon
              sinks. The annual cycle of simulated global averaged CO2,
              dominated by the Northern Hemisphere terrestrial photosynthesis
              and respiration cycles, is reasonably well reproduced, as is the
              latitudinal distribution of CO2 and the dependence of
              interhemispheric CO2 gradient on fossil fuel emissions. The
              empirical approach used here offers a reasonable method of
              implementing down regulation in coupled carbon–climate models in
              the absence of a more explicit biogeochemical representation.",

              indispensable tools for understanding how vegetation behaves

              necessarily complex, containing numerous biophysical parameters
              which are often poorly defined. The current study develops a
              novel retrieval of Rubisco-limited top-of-canopy photosynthetic
              capacity (i.e. maximum carboxylation rate, V cmax 25 , toc ),
              which is one of the most critical parameters in the calculation
              of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). The retrieval combines
              standard remote sensing satellite products of Leaf Area Index
              (LAI), from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
              (MODIS), with a hyperspectral index of total canopy chlorophyll
              concentration from the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer
              (MERIS). Monthly values of V cmax 25 , toc are determined over a
              9 year period for 296 global FLUXNET sites (catalogue made
              available online) and 8 Plant Functional Types (PFTs). PFT
              averages agree favourably with compilations of field-based
              measurements. However, according to a Monte Carlo analysis, our
              method is still currently subject to large systematic
              uncertainties (25–30\%), much of which arises from the empirical
              relationship between maximum electron transport and leaf
              chlorophyll content. For all 8 PFTs, except tropical broadleaf
              forest, V cmax 25 , toc varies considerably across the season
              (generally a factor of 1.6). Similarly, variability between sites
              of the same PFT is significant (interquartile range is 40\% of
              the median). This suggests an important additional role for
              satellites in the spatial and temporal parameterisation of carbon
              models. Inclusion of this temporal and spatial variability in a

                 more seasonal variation in photosynthetic activity across 23
                 tree species than temperature. Although leaves remain green,
                 photosynthetic capacity peaks just after summer solstice and
                 declines with decreasing photoperiod, before air temperatures
                 peak. In support of these findings, saplings grown at constant
                 temperature but exposed to an extended photoperiod maintained
                 high photosynthetic capacity, but photosynthetic activity
                 declined in saplings experiencing a naturally shortening

               content are two of the most sensitive parameters of terrestrial
               biosphere models (TBM) whose representation in global-scale
               simulations has been severely hampered by a lack of systematic
               analyses using a sufficiently broad database. Here, we use data
               of qualitative traits, climate and soil to subdivide the
               terrestrial vegetation into functional types (PFT), and then
               assimilate observations of carboxylation capacity, Vmax (723
               data points), and maximum photosynthesis rates, Amax (776 data
               points), into the C3 photosynthesis model proposed by Farquhar
               et al. to constrain the relationship of (Vmax normalised to 25
               °C) to leaf nitrogen content per unit leaf area for each PFT. In
               a second step, the resulting functions are used to predict per
               PFT from easily measurable values of leaf nitrogen content in
               natural vegetation (1966 data points). Mean values of thus
               obtained are implemented into a TBM (BETHY within the coupled
               climate–vegetation model ECHAM5/JSBACH) and modelled gross
               primary production (GPP) is compared with independent
               observations on stand scale. Apart from providing parameter
               ranges per PFT constrained from much more comprehensive data,
               the results of this analysis enable several major improvements
               on previous parameterisations. (1) The range of mean between
               PFTs is dominated by differences of photosynthetic nitrogen use
               efficiency (NUE, defined as divided by leaf nitrogen content),
               while within each PFT, the scatter of values is dominated by the
               high variability of leaf nitrogen content. (2) We find a
               systematic depression of NUE on certain tropical soils that are
               known to be deficient in phosphorous. (3) of tropical trees
               derived by this study is substantially lower than earlier
               estimates currently used in TBMs, with an obvious effect on
               modelled GPP and surface temperature. (4) The root-mean-squared
               difference between modelled and observed GPP is substantially
               reduced.",

  author   = "Curry, Charles L",
  abstract = "A simple scheme for the soil consumption of atmospheric methane,
              based on an exact solution of the one-dimensional
              diffusion-reaction equation in the near-surface soil layer, is
              described. The model includes a parameterization of biological
              oxidation that is sensitive to soil temperature, moisture
              content, and land cultivation fraction. The scheme was
              incorporated in the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS), with
              forcing provided by a 21-a, global land meteorological data set,
              and was calibrated using multiyear field measurements.
              Application of the scheme on the global scale gives an annual
              mean sink strength of 28 Tg CH4 a−1, with an estimated
              uncertainty range of 9–47 Tg CH4 a−1. A strong seasonality is
              present at Northern Hemisphere high latitudes, with enhanced
              uptake during the summer months. Under the specified surface
              forcings, the oxidation parameterization is more sensitive to
              soil moisture than to temperature. Compared to the previous work
              of Ridgwell et al. (1999), our empirically based water stress
              parameterization reduces uptake more rapidly with decreasing soil
              moisture, resulting in a decrease of ∼50\% in the potential
              global sink strength. Analysis of the geographical distribution
              of methane consumption shows that subtropical and dry tropical
              ecosystems account for over half of the global uptake.",
